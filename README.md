# _**gbArcade**_
![tag](https://github.com/acmuniandes/gbarcade/blob/master/media/title.bmp)
This project aims to port some popular old arcade games to the original gameboy, while still making it posible, memory-wise, for it to fit on an original gameboy cartridge. It is being developed by various members from the Uniandes ACM chapter.

## Planned Games
-Pong
-Breakout
-Asteroids

## Running the proyect

When we upload the .gb file you can run it on your pc by using an emulator (we use  bgb (http://bgb.bircd.org/)), but hopefully any emultor should work.


## Built With
